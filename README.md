# Difference-in-Differences-Regression-Analysis-on-Sponsored-Search-Ads

### Overview
This analysis leverages a natural experiment described in the Columbia Business School case "Measuring ROI on Sponsored Search Ads" by Kinshuk Jerath. The objective is to estimate the causal impact of sponsored search advertising on Bazaar.com’s web traffic and conversion, using a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) regression framework. In particular, the analysis aims to provide a more accurate assessment of the Return on Investment (ROI) of branded keyword advertising campaigns.

### Key Questions
In this report, I applied a DiD regression methodology to address these core business questions in the context of Bazaar.com’s sponsored search advertising. Specifically, the analysis is structured to address the following sub-questions:

(a) What is wrong with Bob’s ROI calculation?

(b) Define the treatment and control groups. What is the unit of observation, and which units are treated or not?

(c) Estimate and interpret the First Difference (pre-post) effect using only the treated group. Why is it problematic to rely solely on this estimate?

(d) Estimate and interpret the treatment effect using a Difference-in-Differences regression.

(e) Propose a revised ROI calculation based on the causal treatment effect estimated through DiD analysis.


### Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates that sponsored ads on Google generate a substantial incremental traffic increase (9,910.6 clicks/week), yielding an ROI of 579.8%, far exceeding Bob’s overstated 320%. The DiD method provides a causal estimate by controlling for market trends, highlighting the value of analytics in advertising decisions.
